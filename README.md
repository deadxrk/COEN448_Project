# COEN448_Project
# Robot Floor Simulation (Java)

## Overview
This project is a Java application that simulates a robot moving on a 2D floor grid.  
The robot tracks its position and pen status (up or down). When the pen is down, the robot marks the floor as it moves.

This project was developed as part of a course lab to practice software design, requirements definition, unit testing, and version control using GitHub.
